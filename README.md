# Magma-Clone

This repository contains a Magma-clone 3D animated website created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features scrolling animations using Canvas, making it look like a 3D animation. This project serves as a practice for beginners to learn and improve their skills in web development and animations.

## Features

- 3D animated scrolling effects
- Smooth and engaging animations
- Interactive elements created with JavaScript

## How It Works

The website uses a technique similar to how a video is divided into frames. Here's a brief explanation:

1. **Frames and Canvas**:
   - The animation is divided into individual frames, each representing a different state of the 3D object or scene.
   - These frames are rendered on an HTML Canvas element.

2. **Scrolling Animation**:
   - As the user scrolls, JavaScript listens for scroll events and calculates the current scroll position.
   - Based on the scroll position, JavaScript determines which frame to display on the Canvas.
   - By quickly switching frames as the user scrolls, it creates the illusion of a smooth 3D animation.

3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - JavaScript manages the loading of frame images and their display.
   - It ensures that the correct frame is displayed based on the user's scroll position, providing a seamless animation experience.
